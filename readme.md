# Debounce and Throttle Implementation

### This project demonstrates the implementation of debounce and throttle techniques in JavaScript. These are essential programming patterns for optimizing performance in web applications, especially when handling frequent events like typing, scrolling, or resizing.

What Are Debounce and Throttle?

#### Debounce

Debounce ensures that a function is executed only after a specified period of inactivity. If the event occurs again within the delay period, the timer resets, postponing the function execution further.

How It Works:

- When an event fires, a timer starts.

- If the event fires again before the timer completes, the timer resets.

- The function executes only after the timer completes without interruptions.

Applications:

- Search Input Fields: Trigger API calls or filtering logic only after the user stops typing.

- Window Resize Events: Avoid frequent layout recalculations during resizing.

- Form Validation: Validate inputs only after the user finishes typing to prevent excessive checks.

#### Throttle

Throttle ensures that a function is executed at most once every specified time interval, regardless of how often the event occurs during that interval.

How It Works:

- The first event triggers the function execution.

- Subsequent events within the delay period are ignored.

- After the delay, the function becomes eligible to execute again if another event occurs.

Applications:

- Scroll Events: Handle actions like infinite scrolling or lazy loading while limiting function calls.

- Click Events: Prevent rapid clicks from triggering multiple calls to a function (e.g., API requests).

- Mouse Move Events: Limit the frequency of event handling in drag-and-drop implementations or drawing applications.
